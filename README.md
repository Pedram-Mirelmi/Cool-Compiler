# Cool-Compiler
This repo contains 3 phases(lexer, parser, semantic analysis) of a compiler for COOL(classroom object oriented language) written in C++ based on the Compiler course of stanford

## First phase is just a simple code written in Cool programming language
## Second phase is the lexer that uses flex
## Third is the parser that uses bison
## Forth phase is the semantic analyzer which is in pure C++ + more that 20 tests
